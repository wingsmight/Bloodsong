        - In order to keep up with the evening festivities, our company decided to
          split up. The local blacksmith did not actually produce the equipment personally,
          in fact, being only a reseller of rusty junk, for lack of anything else.
        - 'James went to him, hoping that Arten could arrange a room for them in
          the tavern.

          It is necessary to explain that Felestina is a country
          of free morals.'
        - But even so, the Felestines are just as human as they are everywhere else.
          And the sense of ownership is not alien to them. As for Arten, James, and
          Zari - they are friends at first, and then everything else.
        - Spending the night in one room or even in a small bed is not a problem
          and is not a reason for obscene thoughts.
        - As James walked through the broken roads of the village to the merchant,
          he remembered with sincerity the first day of their great friendship.
        - "Zari then lived for a couple of years in the village of Kondin \u2013
          the first farmer to settle here."
        - Condin was so prolific that his farm grew before his eyes, becoming a community
          of families directly related to Condin's daughters and sons. He's very
          old now.
        - Zari lived with an aunt, a second cousin of the girl's mother, and on the
          harvest festival, when most of the visitors were walking around in the
          village square, Zari would shop behind the stalls.
        - Due to the assortment that was on sale, the girl was often faced with derogatory
          comments in her address. Zari's aunt sold herbs, mushrooms, and berries,
          the meaning of which was simply unknown to most.
        - "Especially for young people. And now, when Zari was once again listening
          to the taunts in her address, they appeared on the stage \u2013 Arten and
          James."
        - Two guys who first found themselves in the village of Kondin, who could
          not stay away. When Arten and James rudely called out to the offenders,
          the verbal altercation immediately turned into a fight.
        - And although these two, in the end, came out the winners of the fight,
          even then the large and impressive Arten was the most affected party.
        - Beaten, they were going home, not expecting gratitude for their act. It
          was their nature.
        - And despite the fact that Zari, in turn, did not need to be saved and even
          scolded the boys for interfering, she could not let them go.
        - The girl brought the guys to the house of a relative, where she quickly
          put Arten on his feet, thanks to all the same herbs. And from that day
          on, the three of them became almost inseparable.

        - James took his time answering. With a thoughtful look, he began to pace
          around the room, looking at the available choices. In his plans, as well
          as in his determination, the guy was sure.
        - But still, he was a little shy of uncomfortable looks and questions from
          the outside. Yes, the Dandaro merchant shop was extremely unpopular throughout
          the year from year to year.
        - But on the days of the harvest festival, when farmers from the nearest
          land gather in the village of Kondin, the tool dealer is sold out.
        - 'And to avoid any particular inconvenience, James chose today, a quieter
          day.

          However, the presence of Dandaro himself was not canceled.'

          at the swords, while Dandaro watched the young man without interest.
        - In general, life on farms has always been too monotonous for anyone to
          complain.
        - Although the thought of living a life in vain has always seemed too tempting
          for the human race. That's what the Felestines did in the south, and they
          didn't take many other liberties.

          is it possible to continue living like this?

        - There was a moment of silence. Dangerous? Is it dangerous to talk about
          it? But why?
        - The Felestinians do not worship Gods and other inexplicable forces to be
          intimidated by the idea of instant retribution for words.
        - The farmers never denounced each other, so that they were afraid to speak
          openly about what was painful. And who should I inform? Robbers didn't
          mix with hard workers.
        - Farmers were just a valuable resource, whose opinions didn't matter. So
          why would it be dangerous to just talk?
        - Because in the south, the Felestinians had long ago accepted the robbers
          as a given. As with an integral part of being. And dissent can be dangerous
          for an established society.
        - It would be too difficult to fight it. Not here, anyway. Not in the village
          of Condin, which is located at a relatively safe distance from the Iron
          Fist clan and other clans.

        - In order to keep up with the evening festivities, our company decided to
          split up. Zari went to the house of her distant relative, while Arten had
          to arrange a bed for them for the night.
        - It is necessary to explain that Felestina is a country of free morals.
          But even so, the Felestinians are just as human as they are everywhere
          else. And the sense of ownership is not alien to them.
        - As for Arten, James, and Zari - they are friends first, and then everything
          else.
        - Spending the night in one room or even in a small bed is not a problem
          and is not a reason for obscene thoughts.
        - As Zari walked along the broken roads of the village to her aunt, she remembered
          with warmth in her heart the first day of their great friendship.
        - "Zari then lived for a couple of years in the village of Kondin \u2013
          the first farmer to settle here."
        - Condin was so prolific that his farm grew before his eyes, becoming a community
          of families directly related to Condin's daughters and sons. He's very
          old now.
        - Zari lived with an aunt, a second cousin of the girl's mother, and on the
          harvest festival, when most of the visitors were walking around in the
          village square, Zari would shop behind the stalls.
        - 'Due to the assortment that was on sale, the girl was often faced with
          derogatory comments in her address. '
        - Zari's aunt sold herbs, mushrooms, and berries, the meaning of which was
          simply unknown to most. Especially for young people.
        - "And now, when Zari was once again listening to the taunts in her address,
          they appeared on the stage \u2013 Arten and James."
        - Two guys who first found themselves in the village of Kondin, who could
          not stay away. When Arten and James rudely called out to the offenders,
          the verbal altercation immediately turned into a fight.
        - And although these two, in the end, came out the winners of the fight,
          even then the large and impressive Arten was the most affected party.
        - Beaten, they were going home, not expecting gratitude for their act. It
          was their nature.
        - And despite the fact that Zari, in turn, did not need to be saved and even
          scolded the boys for interfering, she could not let them go.
        - The girl brought the guys to the house of a relative, where she quickly
          put Arten on his feet, thanks to all the same herbs. And from that day
          on, the three of them became almost inseparable.

          only the broken hinges were visible. James knew this place well, because
          he visited it every year.
        - And the whole secret was hidden in the product presented for sale. When

          goods piled in all corners.

          out here and there. Mostly swords. And as you might guess, such a product
          did not enjoy overwhelming success.
        - Farmers are essentially thrifty people with respect to tools that directly
          relate to survival in general. But even if something broke, any farmer
          tried to fix it on their own.
        - They knew exactly what it was. Some things had to be replaced and, even

        - Around the perimeter of the entire hall were wooden beams supporting the
          ceiling.
        - On the second floor of the tavern there were tiny rooms for guests, and
          an extra fortification seemed appropriate. There was a strong smell of
          alcohol in the room.
        - Beer mugs endlessly traveled between the posts and the wooden counter,
          under which were whole barrels of intoxicating drink.
        - On the day of the holiday in the kitchen of the tavern, they preferred
          not to cook hearty dishes.
        - Many guests, although they came from distant villages tired and hungry,
          but preferred to wait until the evening to try the dishes from the holiday
          itself.
        - Which explained the sad fact that there was no smell of roast pork. The
          owner's niece greeted Arten with a languid smile. The girl was curvy and
          pretty on the face, but not today.
        - Today, her face was painted with the colors of wild fatigue, pain in her
          legs, and a quiet hatred for all the guests. The guy noticed how the owner
          himself returned from the kitchen, and went to ask about the overnight
          stay.
