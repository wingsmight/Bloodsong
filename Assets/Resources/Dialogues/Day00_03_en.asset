        - In the end, you need to live for today. Right now, James had neither the
          strength, nor the opportunities, nor the sword at his disposal to teach
          all four gangs of robbers a lesson at once.
        - First of all. And secondly, James was of the opinion that rest for the
          body and soul is necessary to be as effective as possible in work. Otherwise,
          just fatigue will take its toll.
        - And even at the most inopportune moment. Therefore, James resolutely followed
          his friends. Straight into the heart of the festivities.
        - It was amazing how easy it was to get lost in this crowd. The inhabitants
          of the village of Kondin and the farmers from the nearby lands could not
          be enough to create human chaos.
        - But this evening everyone seemed so full of life and energy that the crowd
          absorbed the young man in one common organism.
        - Without realizing it, James found himself with a mug of beer in his hand.
          And after drying it, I took up a new one. People kindly offered and passed
          drinks and food to each other.
        - And even wreaths of flowers. The mood of the holiday gradually overcame
          James, somehow enslaving him. And now, he is already dancing among young
          and energetic people.
        - Somewhere in the background, musicians are playing bagpipes and domras.
          Dancers usually do not fall in time with the music. But, I must admit,
          they do not need this at all.
        - There was no place for embarrassment anymore. There was only pleasure left.
          And, almost oblivion in the rhythm of the body. But when James ran into
          her, his intoxication passed and rolled over again.

        - Caused by the charming and stunning beauty of Syra. A resident of the village
          of Kondin, a young and cheerful dancer. That's what she was called, for
          her obvious love of dancing.
        - The love of dancing, which occupies her whole life. She danced so fascinatingly
          that Sira had never worked in the field and was still a favorite among
          farmers.
        - Of course, James had heard a lot about her. And more than once I saw her
          stealthily. But today the young man was seized not by detachment, but by
          attraction.
        - These two collided completely by accident. But just by looking into each
          other's eyes, they could no longer be separated.

        texts:
        - And no matter how well James moved, Syra literally wriggled around him.
        - The girl then pressed her lush breasts against James, mesmerizing with
          a mischievous smile and a playfully submissive look, then turned her back,
          throwing her arms behind her back, wrapping them around James ' neck.
        - Syra sank and rose smoothly, like a cat. She bent her waist in a completely
          unnatural way, snuggling and rubbing her ass, awakening in James his most
          firm determination.
        - And again, Syra was already looking into the guy's eyes. And her hands
          rested gently on his chest. What can I say, this evening a real passion
          flared up between these two.
        - The desire is as it is. They literally burned, burning each other. After
          all, it is so rare in life that such an attraction happens between a man
          and a woman, once they see each other.
        - "Only to come together in a passionate dance. And all these people around\u2026
          It was as if they didn't exist. They continued to frolic and have fun.
          Pushing and kicking. But as if in another reality."
        - James and Syra were only attracted to each other. And the girl, parting
          the edges of James ' jacket, sank along his torso. Giving warm, wet kisses.

        - James crossed his arms over his chest. He saw Arten in the crowd. Together
          with his comrades, the big man drained one mug of beer after another.
        - Snacking on excellent fried wings, the smell of which even reached James.
          There was no sign of Zari. Which is not surprising.
        - She is too small and fragile to be noticed at all. And even more so among,
          as a rule, large farmers. James continued to stand on the sidelines.
        - He always thought that rest and fun are necessary for a person. In order
          not to completely go crazy from a malicious routine.
        - But this whole situation with the robbers just knocked the young man out
          of the rut. He watched the boys and girls dancing in the crowd.
